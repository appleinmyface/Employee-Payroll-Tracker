# Project Title: Employee-Payroll-Tracker
Website that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data...


Purpose of Project:
I build this project to find out the average salary between different employees in an organized matter and also to select a random winner out of the list of employees. 


What does it Do:
It allows you to enter and employees first name, last name, and also his or hers salary. Then it takes their salary's and finds the average whilst also organizing them onto an HTML table.

In the console you can also see the names and salary's that you enter as you enter them in the prompt. 
You can also see the ranomd winner that is chosen in the console. 


How Can You use this Project:
You can use it to keep employees organized based on name, salary, and more if you add more features to it. You can also choose a winner for a reward if you choose to do so.
